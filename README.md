10-19-23 I want this Etch-a-Sketch to have multiple color choices, brush sizes (by pixel), and maybe I can try to do a "shake" animation to reset the Etch-a-Sketch.

10-25-23 I finished the project with three new functions on the Etch-A-Sketch. One is the ability to resize the grid by clicking the 'screen' button on the frame. The second is the 'magic' button that changes the color to a random color. And the third is a 'shake me' button on the emblem on the frame that, when clicked, sets the background back to white after a shaking animation. I also added a text hint underneath the frame that pops up after a few seconds for users who might not realize the buttons are clickable on the frame. I thoroughly enjoyed working on this, and it felt very rewarding to get the multiple functions working.
